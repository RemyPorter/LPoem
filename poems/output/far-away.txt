I feel -
 I cannot touch you

 pace between

         pause!
         atoms mark a distance larger than us
         larger than the shell between our hearts
         between - shell between our hearts
         touch you

 separate us;
 I feel - atoms mark a distance larger than us
 between the shell between our hearts
 touch you

 separate us; -
 I cannot touch you

 pace between

         pause!
         atoms mark a distance larger than us
         larger than the shell between our hearts
         between - shell between our hearts is
                 knife
                 knife
                 - atoms mark a distance larger than us
                 between the shell between our hearts is
                         pause!
                         pause!
                         the distance between us is a knife
                         far away
