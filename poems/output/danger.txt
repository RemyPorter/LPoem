 where moment of danger

 as a part of your time of growing
 along your time within your death

 as a part of flowing
 along where time as fertile soil

 as a part of dying
 moment of danger
 as changing

 growing a part changing the flooded banks changing the sun

 along dying
 lives
 dying
 a moment of danger

 as a part of your time of growing

 becoming a tributary unto changing dying
 the flooded banks along the sun
 along the lives along the my rising along the banks
 flowing a stream
